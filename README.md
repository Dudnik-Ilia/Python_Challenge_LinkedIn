Implementation of the Python Practice: Real-World Coding Challenges course on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-practice-real-world-coding-challenges).

Terminal Scribe is a Python application that performs dynamic drawings directly in the terminal. The project showcases the capabilities of Python's threading and synchronization features to animate multiple "scribes" drawing concurrently on a shared canvas. The Drawing class is capable of plotting functions and executing drawing instructions.

The already drawn picture could be load and used directly via:

`python main.py --input save.canvas`
